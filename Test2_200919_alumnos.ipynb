    "#### Note: This exercise will be reviewed again as soon as new chapters (lops and conditionals) are shown in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read a number with 3 digits and store it in variabe named as number\n",
    "2. Create new 4 variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* units: It stores the units of the given number\n",
    "* rest1: It stores the two remaining digits of the number, after removing the units\n",
    "* tens: It stores the tens of the given number\n",
    "* hundreds:it stores the hundreds of the given number \n",
    "\n",
    "##### IMPORTANT: It is only allowed to divide by 100 or by 10**2 . Students need to used the division operands seen with the divisor = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "3. provide a messalike like the following one but with the number introduced by the user: The introduced number 123 has 3 units, 2 tens and 1 hundreds\n",

    "### Exercise 2: Simulation of a Flipping coin\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. import the following libraries: random, numpy and matplotlib\n",
    "2. Ask the user to introduce a number of coins used in the experiment. Store it in a variable called numberofcoins\n",
    "3. Generate radomly as many 0's or 1's as the number of desired flipped coins.\n",
    "   * For that we are going to use another type of for loop statement that will control the number of values generated:\n",
    "        for i in range(1,numberofcoins_int +1):\n",
    "   * We simulate the heads and the tails of the fipped coind with 0's and 1's. O means head and 1 means tail.\n",
    "   \n",
    "        coinvalue=random.randint(0,1)\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. For each flipped coin provide a message. An example of three flipped coins is given:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Flipping coin number:  1 we have obtained value:  1\n",
    "\n",
    "        Flipping coin number:  2 we have obtained value:  0\n",
    "\n",
    "        Flipping coin number:  3 we have obtained value:  1\n",
    "        \n",
    "5. Calculate themodulus of the obtained value (1 or 0) to identify if it is odd or even\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If the modulus = 0 then a new variable called head will be incremented in one. This variable will count the flipped coins that finished in head. For the one that have modulus = 1 the variable that will count the flipped coins finiched in tail will be caled tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Provide an output message similar to \"After flipping 3 times a coin, we obtained 1 heads and 2 tails\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Create a bar chat using the plot functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use the functions plt.yticks and plt.xticks providing to them a numpy arange: For the yticks the arange will be (0,    \n",
    "      20, 1) and for the xticks will be (0, 2, 1))\n",
    "    * to print a bar use plt.bar(atrib1,atrib2) where atrib1 values 0 or 1 depending the bar we are printing and atrib 2 is \n",
    "      the variable that contains the number of 0's or 1's obtained.\n",
